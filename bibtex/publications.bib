  abstract = {Accretion-based ontology learner (acol) is a ontology learner
      within the sago framework. it accumulates evidence that contributes to
      each relationship between concepts picked up by the ontology learner. this
      means that, instead of having a fixed relationship between concepts, acol
      retains the evidence about the relationships and calculates, or resolves,
      the relationship according to a given context based on user, time, and/or
      location. this can be used to adapt information delivery to different
      contexts when there are multiple sources for (ontology) learning. this
      will be deployed in the myplace system, which is a context-aware system
      designed to provide personalised information delivery in the building of

	This is the first CPU timesharing Fair Share Scheduler. 
	It is the seminal work for now established field of Fair Share Scheduling. 
	The work was motivated by our student's teaching needs, when a shared server ground to a halt near deadlines.
	The share scheduler addressed this by taking the radical approach of viewing this as a human-centred
	problem, with the algorithm scheduling the users, rather than just the processes.
	The software was widely deployed on all major super-computers,
	was mandated by the US Department of Defence and for several years was important for the
	effective function of a large proportion of the world's large web servers.

First user modelling server, and the concept of user model personas.
It pioneered work towards cloud-based storage of personal information that is captured by computers,
for purposes such as making recommendations and personalising teaching.
It introduced mechanisms for users to control the way that their information is managed,
particularly in terms of privacy of personal data.
The notion of a persona was created here as an intuitive way for people to think about the appropriate uses
of their personal data by different applications.

	This work is based on a comprehensive analysis of the full process of `orchestrating' a classroom
	that has a set of interactive tabletops to support group learning activities.
	Orchestration means the design of the learning activities for the class,
	in terms of the times for individual work, those for small group work and for whole class learning.
	In this work, we created mechnaisms to do this systematically, 
	associating the technology with each stage in the planned lesson.
	The paper reports how this was then translated into the `enactment' of the planned activities
	in the actual classroom.
	Technical aspects of this work provided the world's first tabletop classroom.
	We were the first to deploy and evaluate such as classroom
	as part of the normal curriculum, under the real pressures of time and other authentic teaching constraints.
	This involved 236 students across 14 sessions. 
	The main contribution of the paper is an approach for
	designing a multi-tabletop classroom that can help teachers
	plan their learning activities; and provide data for
	assessment and reflection on the enactment of a series of
	classroom sessions.

	that recommend people to people, rather than the dominant case of recommending things to people.
	This work was based on extensive and diverse studies of a 10-year, million user, dataset.
	These explored design and evaluation of algorithms that gave more effective recommendations,
	compared to the state of the art, but also tackled the special problems of reducing
	the changes a person will suffer repeated rejection.
      This paper builds on earlier results to define the nature of these recommenders that we call
	reciprocal, because they require reciprocity for success.
	We point to broader implications of the work, in diverse domains.
