## Previous teaching

**Problem Based Learning (PBL)**:
Over several years, we established and refined the approach to teaching programming fundamentals along with a very broad problem-based skills. 
If you are considering this approach you may find the resources below useful.

**Curriculum mapping:**
The CUSP system was created to tackle the challenge of designing a university curriculum that
builds generic skills such as communication.
This has been commercialised as

**Building group work skills:**
This aspect of my teaching has been core to several HCI and AIED reseach projects.
