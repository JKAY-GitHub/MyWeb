My current projects are:

- Scrutable user modelling. This has been a core focus of my research. Key publications:

First paper on accretion/resolution architecture:
[The um toolkit for cooperative user modelling]
(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01100243)

Thesis - my first use of term "scrutable":
[A scrutable user modelling shell for user- adapted interaction]
(https://www.dropbox.com/s/e9z88zkd6tnybu6/1999_Judy_Kay_thesis.pdf?dl=0)

Summary of first fifteen years work:
[Creating personalized systems that people can scrutinize and control: Drivers, principles and experience]
(https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2395123.2395129)
