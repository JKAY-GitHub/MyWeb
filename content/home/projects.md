- Scrutable user modelling to enable people to be in control of their personal data and its use. Key publications:

	- 1998: My thesis and first use of term "scrutable",
[A scrutable user modelling shell for user-adapted interaction.]
(https://www.dropbox.com/s/e9z88zkd6tnybu6/1999_Judy_Kay_thesis.pdf?dl=0)
I chose scrutable to reflect the effort people need to invest --
this contrasts with the common term transparent.
Scrutable is human-centred, describing what people do, -- by contrast, eXplainable AI is what machine does.

- Interfaces and infrastructure for life-wide and life-long learning from long term data. This has several threads
	- Open Learner Models (OLMs) - interfaces onto learning data to support self-regulated learning powered by long term data;
	- teaching systems: e-textbook of the future, teaching system for communication in oncology by the TRIO, clinician-patient-carer.
	- interfaces for long term personal data from wearables, such as smart watches, appliances and customised hardware to help people tackle long term personal goals for health and wellness;
	- dashboards for medical clinical indicator data to inform medical teams' professional development;
	- tackling truth decay by creating personalised interfaces that enable people to judge the trustworthiness of online science news;

All of these build on aspects of scutability and enabling people to harness their long term data to support learning.
