I lead the multi-disciplinary Human Centred Technology Research Cluster at the University of Sydney, Australia. 

My research is in the areas of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). She leads the Human Centred Technology Research Cluster, a large multi-disciplinary group at the University of Sydney. A core focus of her research it to create system that harness personal data for personalisation with user control, based on creating systems and interfaces to enable people to scrutinize their own user model and the personalisation processes based on it. In AIED, this is called Open Learner Modelling, now linking with learning analytics. In Ubicomp, her work has explored the ways to create infrastructures, as well as interfaces, that enable people to control the management of evidence used to reason about them.  Her research has resulted in deployed human-centred technology, making research contributions in interface design, user experience, machine learning and data mining, and infrastructures for personal data management to ensure privacy and user control.
