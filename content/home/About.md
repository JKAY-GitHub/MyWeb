I lead the multi-disciplinary 
[Human Centred Technology Research Cluster]
(https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/data-science-and-computer-engineering/human-centred-technology.html)
at the University of Sydney, Australia. 


My research is in the areas of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) and 
Human Computer Interaction (HCI). 
A core focus of my research is to create system that enable people to harness their personal data for lifelong and lide-wide learning.
This means creating systems and interfaces that for user modelling that enables people to scrutinize their 
model and the personalisation processes based on it. 
In AIED, this is called Open Learner Modelling, now linking with learning analytics. 
In Ubicomp, my research has created infrastructures, as well as interfaces, 
that enable people to control the management of data used to reason about them.  
My research has resulted in deployed human-centred technology, 
making research contributions in interface design, user experience, 
machine learning and data mining, and infrastructures for personal data management to ensure privacy and user control.
