I lead the Human Centred Technology Research Cluster. This highly multi-disciplinary group is a priority research area for the Faculty of Engineering and IT.

My primary research and teaching is in human computer interaction (HCI) and ranges from creating new technology to studies to inform its design and learn about its use.

My research group, CHAI: Computer Human Adapted Interaction Research Group works on personalisation, particularly for life-long, life-wide learning and novel interfaces. 
Our surface computing work makes tabletops and walls interactive, such as the Sydney University MediaWall. 
Our spin-off company, Cruiser Interactive has deployed the technology at diverse sites such as Alzheimer's Australia, Mondelez, Victoria Police,Colliers and in Education.

This page complements my formal home page as a highly dynamic resource for my students and colleagues. Enjoy!
