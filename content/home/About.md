I lead the multi-disciplinary 
[Human Centred Technology Research Cluster]
(https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/data-science-and-computer-engineering/human-centred-technology.html)
at the University of Sydney, Australia. 


My research is in the areas of 
Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), 
Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) and 
Human Computer Interaction (HCI). 
A core driver has been to create systems that enable people to harness 
their personal data for lifelong and life-wide learning.
My research creates systems and interfaces for *user models* that people can *scrutinise*,
to really see, understand and control their personal data and its use.
This is core to people managing privacy and use of their data.
In learning contexts, interfaces onto learning data, Open Learner Models (OLM), 
provide a new way for people to harness data to manage their learning.
This is because it suppose *metacognitive processes* like self-monitoring, reflection and planning,
closely related to *self-regulation* in lifelong learning for important areas of health and wellness.
My research is based on rich collaborations with researchers in diverse areas,
such as nutrition, physical activity, psychology, medical informatics and ehealth.
